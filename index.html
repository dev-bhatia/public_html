            <h5>
                "Be T Shaped" was one of the best pieces of advice I got near the end of my freshman year. The horizontal bar at the top of the "T" represents all that you know, and the vertical bar in the middle represents the depth to which you know something. I've observed that in most engineering curriculums at UCSD, students gain an in-depth understanding of their major only. This is not sufficient. <br><br>
                Generally there are three main fields of engineering (software, electronics, and mechanical), within which there are different majors/disciplines. I know there's also bio/chem/nano and many others that do not fit into these, but the point is don't limit yourself to just one. For example, if you major within software engineering, complement that with some electronics fundamentals ("People who really care about software, build their own hardware" or something like that).<br><br>
                I could pair different majors and go into how they complement one another, but what I've observed is to have a good understanding of the digital (software, computing) and physical (electrical hardware, robotics, structures) worlds as much as you can.

                UCSD has 7 colleges (6 when I started, maybe even more now).
