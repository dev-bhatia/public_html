          This is my reflection on the undergrad engineering experience and some stuff I
          learned along the way. A little bit about me - I studied electrical
          engineering at UC San Diego, was part of some student orgs, worked
          on-campus at the Career Center, volunteered at a neuroscience research lab 
          (Shtrahman Lab), and held internships at Intel, Tesla, and Microsoft 
          during my undergrad. Obviously, this is all just my opinion.

          <p>
            "Be T Shaped" was one of the best pieces of advice I got near the
            end of my freshman year. The horizontal bar at the top of the "T"
            represents all that you know, and the vertical bar in the middle
            represents the depth to which you know something. I've observed that
            in most engineering curriculums at UCSD, students gain an in-depth
            understanding of their major only. This is not sufficient.
            <br /><br />
            Generally there are three main fields of engineering (software,
            electronics, and mechanical), within which there are different
            majors/disciplines. I know there's also bio/chem/nano and many
            others that do not fit into these, but the point is don't limit
            yourself to just one. For example, if you major within software
            engineering, complement that with some electronics fundamentals
            ("People who are really serious about software, should make their
            own hardware" -
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay" target="_blank">
              Alan Kay
            </a>). 
            <br /><br />
            Sure, I could pair different majors and go into how they complement one
            another, but ultimatley what it comes down to is to have a good 
            understanding of the digital (software, computing) and physical (electrical 
            hardware, robotics, structures) worlds as much as you can. 
            I cannot stress this enough.

              My Inventions
              <br />
              <i>by Nikola Tesla</i>
            </b>
            <br />
            Sometimes we forgot what it means to invent or why even continue studying engineering -
            this short autobiography reinstills the spirit of innovation & excitement to engineer.
            <br /><br />

            <b>
              The No B.S. Guide to Linear Algebra
              <br />
              <i>by Ivan Savov</i>
            </b>
            <br />
            A very striaghforward approach to learning one of the most
            fundemental topics in math. At the very least, you will learn how to
            "read" math. Knowing how to read math will expedite your ability to
            grasp concepts, definitions, and theorems in your couses.

              Cracking the PM Interview
              <br />
              <i>by Gayle Laakmann McDowell &&nbsp;Jackie&nbsp;Bavaro</i>
            </b>
            <br />
            Regardless of your intent to purse the PM role or your ability to
            engineer solutions, great teams indirectly seek out people who can
            access the impact and reach of their work both internally for the
            team and externally for users. This book helps you develop that
            mindest through real examples and clear guidance.

            </b>
            <br />
            Short, straightforward, and simple. Takes ~20 to 30 minutes to read.

            <b>4 Year Plan(s)</b>
            This is like any other plan...it will change. Two quarters into my
            first year, I stopped following the recommended four year plan and
            made my own instead. The reason: I wanted more project based classes
            with hands-on learning rather than learning only theory. There are
            pros and cons to deviating from the recommended plan. The con: you
            don't take classes consistently with the same people your year (the
            consequence being you have to make more of an effort to get to know
            people each quarter in your classes). The pro: you can prioritize
            classes based on your needs (project based classes, graduating
            early, etc). Looking back, taking project based or application
            focused classes early helps build up your resume with tangible skill
            and experience and you become more capable of builings things
            sooner, rather than later.
            <br /><br />
            <b>(most) textbooks are a scam</b>
            Always avoid purchasing textbooks. Two reasons: professors barely
            use them expect for assigning homework & you'll end up learning more
            from YouTube videos anyways. You can most likely (~95% chance) find
            a PDF of the book online. I want to be very clear - I am not
            encouraging this, just stating a probablity :)

            <b>UCSD College System</b>
            UCSD has 7 colleges. No, they are not like the houses in Hogwarts no
            matter what anybody tells you. Colleges only matter for two things -
            where you live on-campus (if you decide to) and what your GEs will
            be. The latter is more important as most of campus is pretty nice.
            Sixth has the best and easiest GEs, Muir and Warren are tied for
            second, Marshall is just there (very neutral), ERC and Seventh have
            too many writing classes (avoid if you can).
            <br /><br />
            <b>Writing GEs</b>
            Regardless of what college you end up in, everyone has to take a
            writing sequence as part of their GEs. Use them to boost your GPA as
            an engineering major. It all comes down to your TAs. These people
            have the most influence on your grades. In writing classes, go to
            their office hours occasionally to get feedback on your work (when,
            not if, you make their suggested changes) you will more likely get a
            higher score than if you didn't go
